## Section Being Written
The "Key Principles" section needs content. Expected principles:
- Fail fast
- Graceful degradation
- Timeout everything
- Idempotency
- Health checks

## Style
- Use bullet points for principles
- Each principle should have a brief explanation (1-2 sentences)
- Keep it practical, not theoretical
